얻었습니다.\n","\n","- **YOLOv2 (2016년):** 원래 모델을 개선하여 배치 정규화(batch normalization), 앵커 박스(anchor boxes), 차원 클러스터(dimension clusters) 등을 도입했습니다.\n","- **YOLOv3 (2018년):** 보다 효율적인 백본 네트워크(backbone network), 여러 앵커(anchor) 및 공간 피라미드 풀링(spatial pyramid pooling)을 사용해 성능을 더욱 향상시켰습니다.\n","- **YOLOv4 (2020년):** Mosaic 데이터 증강, 새로운 앵커 프리(anchor-free) 탐지 헤드, 새로운 손실 함수 등을 도입하여 혁신을 이루었습니다.\n","- **YOLOv5:** 모델 성능을 더욱 개선하고, 하이퍼파라미터 최적화, 실험 추적 통합, 인기 있는 형식으로의 자동 내보내기 등의 새로운 기능을 추가했습니다.\n","- **YOLOv6 (2022년):** Meituan에서 오픈 소스로 공개되었으며, 자율 배달 로봇 등 다양한 응용 분야에서 사용되고 있습니다.\n","- **YOLOv7:** COCO 키포인트 데이터셋에서 포즈 추정과 같은 추가 작업을 지원했습니다.\n","- **YOLOv8:** Ultralytics에서 개발한 최신 버전으로, 탐지, 분할, 포즈 추정, 추적, 분류 등 다양한 비전 AI 작업을 지원하는 첨단 모델입니다. 이전 버전의 성공을 기반으로 성능, 유연성, 효율성을 더욱 향상시킨 특징이 있습니다.\n","- **YOLOv9:** Programmable Gradient Information(PGI)과 Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network(GELAN)과 같은 혁신적인 방법을 도입했습니다.\n","- **YOLOv10:** 칭화대학교 연구팀이 Ultralytics Python 패키지를 사용해 개발했으며, Non-Maximum Suppression(NMS) 요구를 제거하는 엔드
